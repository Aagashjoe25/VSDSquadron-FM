## üöÄ Getting Started

New to this repository? Follow these two simple steps to get set up and running.

### Step 1: Install the Toolchain
First, you need to set up the required open-source FPGA tools (**Yosys, iCEstorm, nextpnr**). A complete, step-by-step guide for Ubuntu 22.04 is provided.

### Step 2: Explore the Projects
Once your toolchain is ready, you can dive into the projects! The navigator below lists all completed and planned projects.
